# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Project Description

This was a 3 week project that helped me practice how to use React and to familiarize myself with its features. This project also implements a lot of JSX and CSS/HTML. I built this project with the inspiration and my heart for the medical field. As someone who previously worked in the medical field, I realized how unefficient it is for a doctor's office to hold so many physical copies of a patients charts and history records. 

Therefore, my intentions for creating such an application derives from the wanting to help make the filing system in the clinics and doctor offices to be more convenient. With many offices already transitioned to electronic database of patient records, it has become much more efficient and easier to access. 

Therefore, this application stores information such as their name, age, height, weight, phone number, address, and insurance. And depending on the clinical or office, we can implement other information if needed to be stored, such as underlying health conditions that may be of concern and medications that are currently being taken.
